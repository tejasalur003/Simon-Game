# Simon-Game
Simon is a classic memory game where players need to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that grows longer with each round.

Simon features four colored buttons, each producing a distinct tone when pressed. The game randomly generates a sequence of colors and sounds, which players must replicate accurately. With every successful replication, the sequence lengthens, challenging the player's memory and concentration.

Simon is as much about fun and concentration as it is about memory. Enjoy the game and see how far you can go!
